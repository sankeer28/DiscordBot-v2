Discord bot made using Python with many features including AI chat, music playback, video downloader, OSINT tools, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ üêç** 3.10 if you want the OSINT tool [Maigret](https://github.com/sankeer28/DiscordBot-v2/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#to-use-the-command-maigret-)
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/): installed onto system PATH
  - Linux (apt): 
  ```sudo apt install ffmpeg```
  - MacOS (via homebrew): 
      ```brew install ffmpeg```
  - Windows: [guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ffmpeg#:~:text=successfully%20installed%20FFmpeg.-,how%20to%20install%20ffmpeg%20on%20windows,-Before%20the%20installation):

## Features
### Chat Interaction üí¨:
- Casual chat with the bot using its name. Not required to call its name if using the bot's DMs.
- Immediate responses using Gemini AI.
- Conversation is temporarily saved to memory for realism.
- 50/50 chance to get a GIF from Giphy based on the context of what is being said in chat using NLP.
  - [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) NLP identifies the most relevant parts of a message by focusing on nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, and verbs, excluding personal pronouns which might not contribute much to the context.

### Media Retrieval üì∫:
- Returns images from [Google](https://www.google.com).
- Searches [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) for videos.
- Returns images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com).

### Image Related üñºÔ∏è:
- Finds the source of images through reverse image search supporting various formats using [SauceNao](https://saucenao.com/).
- Asks questions regarding uploaded images using [Gemini AI](https://gemini.google.com/).

### OSINT Tools üîì:
- Integrates with [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)
- Integrates with modified [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/WhatsMyName-Python). Returns either links to chat or creates html file with --html argument.
- Integrates with [socialscan](https://github.com/iojw/socialscan).
- Integrates with [Maigret](https://github.com/soxoj/maigret) - **Not compatible with modern Python versions, must enable** [manually](https://github.com/sankeer28/DiscordBot-v2/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#to-use-the-command-maigret-)
- Logs info of members in servers, including the user's Discord IDs, server nickname, Discord username, and status/bio, into a folder called Servers as .json files.

### Voice Chat üéôÔ∏è:

### Leveling System üìà:
- Users gain xp by sending messages.
- Users receive a notification in the current chat when they level up.
- Commands available:
  - `level`: Check your current level and experience points.
